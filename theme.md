# Theme Overview
This document would describe the site's theme. This includes the starter theme used, the features, and the design decisions.

## Starter Theme
The starter theme that we are utilizing is the `Twenty Twenty Two` theme since it allows us to make use of the theme editor to edit the theme to our preferences. After we copied the contents of this theme, we renamed it to `Baizonn Learning Centre` in order for us to make changes from there, without affecting the original theme.

## Theme Features
Both the starter and the chosen theme allows us to create a template without affecting the content itself. Unlike the other WordPress themes before it, the Customize option is more limited since most of its functionality is replaced by the theme editor. However, it still has its uses like changing the fonts using the Google Fonts plugin, and changing the favicon of the website itself.

## Design Decisions
